# LIST COMPREHENSIONS

anywhere you can use a list, you can use a list comprehension. 

## What are List comprehensions ?

- List comprehensions are a unique way to create lists in Python. 

- A list comprehension consists of `brackets containing and expression followed by a for clause, then zero or more for or if clauses`. 

- List comprehensions will commonly take the form of `[<value> for <vars> in <iter>]`.

### **Example 1:**

 list of strings into a list of string lengths.

 *using normal declarations*

    ```py
    >>> names = ["Nina", "Max", "Rose", "Jimmy"]
    >>> my_list = [] # empty list
    >>> for name in names:
    ...     my_list.append(len(name))
    ...
    >>> print(my_list)
    [4, 3, 4, 5]
    ```

 *using list comprehensions*

 ```py
 >>> names = ["Nina", "Max", "Rose", "Jimmy"]
>>> my_list = [len(name) for name in names]
>>> print(my_list)
[4, 3, 4, 5]
 ```

 ### **Example 2:**

  assemble a list of tuples - each tuple contains the element “length” as well as each number from the len() function multiplied by two.

  ```py
  >>> names = ["Nina", "Max", "Rose", "Jimmy"]
>>> my_list = [("length", len(name) * 2) for name in names]
>>> print(my_list)
[('length', 8), ('length', 6), ('length', 8), ('length', 10)]
  ```

   ### **Example 3:** using Conditions

   to quickly make a list of only the even lengths, you could do:

   ```py
   >>> names = ["Nina", "Max", "Rose", "Jimmy"]
>>> my_list = [len(name) for name in names if len(name) % 2 == 0]
>>> print(my_list)
[4, 4]
   ```

### **Example 4:** String Joining

```py
>>> my_list = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
>>> my_string = ",".join([str(num) for num in my_list])
>>> print(my_string)
0,1,2,3,4
```

### **Example 5:** Sum, Min, Max

to get the sum of numbers between zero and five

```py
my_sum = sum([0, 1, 2, 3, 4])
print(my_sum)
```

 to get sum, minimum, and maximum of every number between 0 and 100 that is evenly divisible by 3

 ```py
 >>> my_sum = sum([num for num in range(0, 100) if num % 3 == 0])
>>> print(my_sum)
1683
>>> my_min = min([num for num in range(0, 100) if num % 3 == 0])
>>> print(my_min)
0
>>> my_max = max([num for num in range(0, 100) if num % 3 == 0])
>>> print(my_max)
99
 ```

 # Dictionary Comprehensions

- similar to list comprehensions
 
- Dictionary comprehensions are a quick and easy way of assembling dictionaries in Python. 

- they use curly braces instead of square brackets 

- they contain two variables (for key and value), separated by a colon.

### **Example 1:**

to assemble a dict in which the keys are numbers between 0 and 10, and the values are the same number squared

```py
>>> squares = {num:num * num for num in range(10)}
>>> print(squares)
{0: 0, 1: 1, 2: 4, 3: 9, 4: 16, 5: 25, 6: 36, 7: 49, 8: 64, 9: 81}
```
### **Example 2:**
use f-strings to assemble a dict to keep game scores:

```py
>>> scores = {f"player-{num}":0 for num in range(0, 5)}
>>> print(scores)
{'player-0': 0, 'player-1': 0, 'player-2': 0, 'player-3': 0, 'player-4': 0}
```
### **Example 3:**

```py
>>> my_list = [(f"player-{num}", num * 2) for num in range(0, 5)]
>>> print(my_list)
[('player-0', 0), ('player-1', 2), ('player-2', 4), ('player-3', 6), ('player-4', 8)]
>>>
>>> scores = {key:value for (key, value) in my_list}
>>> print(scores)
{'player-0': 0, 'player-1': 2, 'player-2': 4, 'player-3': 6, 'player-4': 8}
```
# Set Comprehensions

-  they look like a cross between list and dict comprehensions, and they create set objects.

### **Example 1:**
```py
>>> my_set = {num for num in [1, 2, 1, 0, 3]}
>>> print(my_set)
{0, 1, 2, 3}
```

# Generator Expressions

- A generator is a type of iterable object - like a list, you can iterate through each element 
- however, unlike a list, generators evaluate elements on demand, instead of assembling them all at once.
- A generator comprehension looks just like a list comprehension, except we use parenthesis instead of brackets.

## Use ?

Generator comprehensions can be beneficial in circumstances where you want to iterate over very large lists without storing the entire list in memory. 

### **Example 1:**

to get a list of the square of every even number between 0 and 10

```py
# List comprehension
>>> list_comp = [x ** 2 for x in range(10) if x % 2 == 0]
>>> print(list_comp)
[0, 4, 16, 36, 64]

# Generator expression
>>> gen_exp = (x ** 2 for x in range(10) if x % 2 == 0)
>>> print(gen_exp)
<generator object <genexpr> at 0x10d48cc00>
>>> for num in gen_exp:
...     print(num)
...
0
4
16
36
64
```
### **Example 2:**

- Generator comprehensions can be beneficial in circumstances where you want to iterate over very large lists without storing the entire list in memory. 

For example, if you tried to assemble a list of every number between 0 and 10 ** 8 (10 to the 8th power), Python will try to assemble the entire list in memory. 

Using the `timeit` library to create this list only once, we can see how long this takes

```py
# list comprehension
>>> list_comp = "[num for num in range(0, 10 ** 8)]"

>>> timeit.timeit(list_comp, number=1)
7.578090285999998
# Over 7 seconds just to assemble one huge list


# Let's do the same with a generator comprehension instead:
>>> gen_comp = "(num for num in range(0, 10 ** 8))"

>>> timeit.timeit(gen_comp, number=1)
9.919999996554907e-06

>>> timeit.timeit(gen_comp, number=10000000)
7.211805443999992
```
