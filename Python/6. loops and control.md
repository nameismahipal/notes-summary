## For Loop

```
for single_item in items: 
     new line
```

for single_item in items, followed by a colon : , followed by a new line, a level of indentation, and the code you’d like to consider as the body of the loop.

```py
>>> colors = ["Red", "Green", "Blue", "Orange"]
>>> for color in colors:
...     print(f"The color is: {color}")
The color is: Red
The color is: Green
The color is: Blue
The color is: Orange
```

#### Looping over a range of numbers

range()
- built-in function called range(). 
- The range function in python produces a sequence of integers from an optional and inclusive start, to a defined and exclusive finish.

```
>>> for num in range(5):
...     print(f"The number is: {num}")
...
The number is: 0
The number is: 1
The number is: 2
The number is: 3
The number is: 4
```

If you want to explicitly see what a call to range() produces for debugging purposes, you can pass the result into the list() method to see all the values at once. 

```
>>> list(range(5))
[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
```

#### if we wanted the range from 1 to 4, instead of 0 to 4? 
range() can be called with start and stop parameters
```
>>> for num in range(1, 5):
...     print(f"The number is: {num}")
```

#### third optional step parameter 

```
>>> for num in range(4, 11, 2):
...     print(f"The number is: {num}")
...
The number is: 2
The number is: 4
The number is: 6
The number is: 8
The number is: 10
```

## Looping over items with the index using Enumerate()

sometimes we need a way to access the index of the items we’re looping through. 

To do that we use a special function called `enumerate()`

`enumerate()` function takes a sequence, like a list, and it returns a list of tuples, containing the index of the item in the sequence, and the sequence itself.

```
>>> colors = ["Red", "Green", "Blue", "Orange"]
>>> for index, item in enumerate(colors):
...     print(f"Item: {item} is at index {index}")
... 
Item: Red is at index 0
Item: Green is at index 1
Item: Blue is at index 2
Item: Orange is at index 3
>>> 
```

## Looping over a dictionary

:warning: Remember, a dictionary is composed of (key, value) pairs. When we loop over a dictionary with the **for item in my_dict** syntax, we’ll end up looping over **just** the keys.

``` py
>>> hex_colors = {
... "Red": "#FF",
... "Green": "#008",
... "Blue": "#0000FF",
... }
>>> 
>>> for color in hex_colors:
...     print(f"The value of color is : {color}")
... 
The value of color is : Red
The value of color is : Green
The value of color is : Blue
>>> 
>>>  # Here we have undesired behaviour.
>>>
>>> # If we want to loop over the (key, value) pairs in a dictionary, we’ll want to call `my_dict.items()`.
>>>
>>> for color, hex_value in hex_colors.items():
...     print(f"For color {color}, the hex value is {hex_value}")
... 
For color Red, the hex value is #FF
For color Green, the hex value is #008
For color Blue, the hex value is #0000FF
>>> 
```

#  IF, ELSE, ELIF

## IF
`if` in Python means: **only run the rest of this code once, if the condition evaluates to True**. Don’t run the rest of the code at all if it’s not. Indentation is necassary.

```py
>>> if 3 < 5:
...     print("Hello, World!")
...
Hello, World!
```

## NOT

Using not With if Statements

If you only want your code to run if the expression is False, use the not keyword.
```py
>>> b = False
>>> if not b:
...     print("Negation in action!")
...
Negation in action!
```

## If Statements and Truthiness

For example:

- The number 0 is False
- any other number (including negatives) is Truth
- An empty list, set, tuple or dict is False
- Any of those structures with items in it is Truth

```py
>>> message = "Hi there."

>>> a = 0
>>> if a:   # 0 is False
...     print(message)
...

>>> b = -1
>>> if b:  # -1 is Truth
...     print(message)
...
Hi there.

>>> c = []
>>> if c:  # Empty list is False
...     print(message)
...

>>> d = [1, 2, 3]
>>> if d:  # List with items is Truth
...     print(message)
...
Hi there.
```

### If Statements and Functions

```py
>>> def modify_name(name):
...    if len(name) < 5:
...         return name.upper()
...    else:
...         return name.lower()
...
>>> name = "Mahi"
>>> modify_name(name)
'Mahi'
```
#### Warning
:warning:
 In Python, we do not want to compare to True or False with ==

 ```py
 # Warning: Don't do this!
>>> if (3 < 5) == True: # Warning: Don't do this!
...     print("Hello")
...
Hello

# Warning: Don't do this!
>>> if (3 < 5) is True: # Warning: Don't do this!
...     print("Hello")
...
Hello
 ```

Toexplicitly check if the value is explicitly set to True or False, we can use the `is` keyword.

```py
>>> a = True        # a is set to True
>>> b = [1, 2, 3]   # b is a list with items, is "truthy"
>>>
>>> if a and b:     # this is True, a is True, b is "truthy"
...     print("Hello")
...
Hello
>>> if a is True:   # we can explicitly check if a is True
...     print("Hello")
...
Hello
>>> if b is True:   # b does not contain the actual value of True.
...     print("Hello")
...
>>>
```

### elif Means Else, If.
```py
>>> a = 5
>>> if a > 10:
...     print("Greater than 10")
... elif a < 10:
...     print("Less than 10")
```

# While Loops

```py
>>> while counter < max:
...     print(f"The count is: {counter}")
...     counter = counter + 1
```

:warning: loop will run forever if we forget to update the sentinel value. Press Ctrl-C to exit the infinite loop.

# BREAK, CONTINUE, AND RETURN

- `break` statement will completely break out of the **current** loop (not the outer loop incase break declared in inner loop of nested loops) 
- `continue` goes back to the start of the loop, skipping over any other statements contained within the loop.
