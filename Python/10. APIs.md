- Requests and Response

## API

API is a set of functions and procedures allowing the creation of applications, that access the features or data of an operating system/ application or other service.

An API is a standardized way of accessing information across the web, between clients and servers. 

These days most APIs are RESTful.

RESTFUL - means they follow a common set of paradigms and practices.

## Requests and Response

Working with APIs using HTTP depends on the request and response cycle. 

You send a request to the server, and it lets you know if your request was successful or by sending an HTTP Status Code with a special meaning, and will optionally send back data.

- Server: 
    > A powerful computer that runs an API
- API: 
    > The "hidden" portion of a website that is meant for computer consumption
- Client: 
    > A program that exchanges data with a server through an API

### HTTP Methods

The HTTP Method is how you tell the server which type of operation you’d like to perform.

- GET - Asks the server to retrieve a resource
- POST - Asks the server to create a new resource
- PUT - Asks the server to edit/update an existing resource
- DELETE - Asks the server to delete a resource  

### Response Types

Servers can respond in a variety of file formats, like JSON, XML, and others.

JSON is the most common format. For many servers, it’s the default if you don’t specify a response type.

JSON is a common format of capturing data, and it’s easy to read and generate from a variety of programming languages.

A JSON example:
```JSON
[
	{
		"name": "New York",
		"pop": 8550405
	},
	{
		"name": "Los Angeles",
		"pop": 3971883
	},
	{
		"name": "Chicago",
		"pop": 2720546
	},
]
```

### HTTP Status Codes
HTTP Status Codes is a numerical response from the sever, indicating the status of your request.

They tend to fall into these categories:

- 1xx : Informational
Not commonly used.
- 2xx : Success
    - 200 OK - Standard response for successful HTTP requests.
    - 201 CREATED - A new resource was created successfully.
- 3xx : Redirection
    - 301 Moved Permanently - This and all future requests should be directed to the new URL.
- 4xx : A Client Error
    - 404 Not Found - An entry wasn’t found based on the information the client gave.
- 5xx : A Server Error
    - 500 Internal Server Error - Something went wrong with the server.
